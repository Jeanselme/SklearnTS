# SklearnTS
Adaptation of sklearn to easily train and test model on time series data

## Goal 
This library allows to easily manipulates time series data and to use standard model from sklearn.  
This project has been created for any multi time series data that necessitate a classification at each time points. Further enhancement will also allow time series classification and comparion.

## Dependencies
Executed with python2 and python3 with pandas, numpy and sklearn libraries.

## Project

### Distances
Contains standard distances for time series

### Metrics
Evaluation metrics for time series

### Models
Embedding to use standard models from sklearn but also models specialy created for handling time series data

### Normalization
Used for time series normalization

### Tests
Unittests and example of notebooks for usecase

### Utils
All other functions shared through all previous folders
